Hi there ðŸ‘‹ , my name is RenÃª Tolentino and I'm 27 y old.

I'm looking for work as Web Dev, so I started to study PHP, SQL, JS, CSS and HTML, so in just one month, I reached more than 110 hours of practice. (May I got addicted to it? ðŸ˜‚)

I do still have a lot to learn, so that's why I'm here.

This is my first contact with the Dev community so, hope I can rely on guys for help.

I'm a bit ashamed to say, but I never had an professional experience (as dev), and never worked together in any project.

So we have to start somewhere, and here I am.

If you want to contact me, feel free to send a DM on twitter: @chavocrust.
